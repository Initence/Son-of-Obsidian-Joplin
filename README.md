# Son-of-Obsidian-Joplin
## Background
I've used the theme ["Son of Obsidian"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rprouse.theme-obsidian) by Rob Prouse for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code for many years. It uses a cohesive dark aesthetic with good contrast that I really appreciate. 

When I found out that you can customize [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) with CSS I decided to create my own version of the theme.

I am no CSS expert but I've used the "Toggle Development Tools" in the Help menu in Joplin and worked out the classes that I wanted to target. Finally I polished the CSS with the help of [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

I have used [Name that color](https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/) to give the colors descriptive names.

## Installation
Copy the userchrome.css and userstyle.css into the profile directory for Joplin on your system. Follow the [Custom CSS instructions](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/custom_css) from Joplin for more details.

This is an example of what the theme looks like:
